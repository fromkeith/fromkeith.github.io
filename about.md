My name is Keith!

I am the CTO and Co-founder of [PicThrive](https://www.picthrive.com).

I went to the University of Waterloo for Software Engineering (SE2011). I spent some time at Google, Amazon, BlueSun and Digital Extremes. Before starting this crazy venture called being a founder I was at Amazon working on real-time video & audio streaming. I have been working away at being a founder since 2014. Its been a long journey and I have learnt a lot!
