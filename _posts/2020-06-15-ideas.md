# Ideas

The following are random product ideas I think would be cool, but haven't ever investigated. Feel free to take them and build away.

* "Zapier for AWS". UI based tool for automating or easily repeating common commands. Need kick off a build? Hit a button. Solves
those tasks that I dont' want to code for, but want to eleminate all those extr clicks for.
* "Sublime for Github". A new view for navigating Github. Sometimes I want to figure out how a github project works. However,
I don't want to spend the investment time to clone the repo. Having an easily navigatable side view with file tabs would make
it way easier to understand how a repo operates.
